# The Data-Sitters Club. Because DH should be fun.

                <p>Looking for a place to get started with digital humanities, without investing a ton of time? Data-Sitters Little TL;DR is there for you.</p>
                <p>
                        Our main series (<a href="https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/books">DSC</a>) is aimed at people who already know they want to use digital humanities tools. But what if you don’t know if digital humanities is right for you?</p>

<p>Welcome to our new spinoff series: DSC’s Little TL;DR (short for “too long; didn’t read”), where we offer key ideas and takeaways for people interested in digital humanities but not sure if it’s for them. We’re not here to convert, just to help — all in 1,500 words or less!</p>
